🌍 gRPC Architecture for Pacts
1️⃣ Server (Job Scheduler)
Runs the Scheduler and JobManager.

Accepts job submission, queries, and scheduling requests.

Sends job status updates to clients.

2️⃣ Clients (Job Submitters)
Submit jobs to the gRPC server.

Request job status updates.

Verify scheduling integrity.

🛠 Implementation Plan
Define gRPC Protobuf (scheduler.proto)

Define job submission, job status, and scheduling RPCs.

Implement gRPC Server (scheduler_server.py)

Manages jobs and schedules them.

Implement gRPC Client (scheduler_client.py)

Submits jobs and fetches job status.

🎯 What This Adds to Pacts
✅ Distributed job submission using gRPC.
✅ Clients can submit jobs remotely.
✅ Scheduler decides execution based on priority & resources.
✅ Jobs can be queried for their status.

💡 Next Steps
Implement multiple scheduler nodes for distributed scheduling.

Enhance job execution to actually run commands in a subprocess.

Persist job data in a database.
