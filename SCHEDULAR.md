üìå Scheduler in Pacts: Role & Working Mechanism
üîπ Role of the Scheduler in Pacts
The scheduler is the core component of the Pacts system, responsible for allocating and executing jobs efficiently while verifying integrity using Merkle trees. It ensures that:

‚úÖ Jobs are prioritized based on importance.
‚úÖ System resources (CPU, memory, GPU) are optimally allocated.
‚úÖ Jobs execute in an efficient manner without overloading the system.
‚úÖ Distributed verification of scheduled jobs is possible via Merkle trees.

Since Pacts is a distributed scheduler, it also interacts with remote clients using gRPC, allowing job submission, status checking, and distributed execution.

üîπ How the Scheduler Works
The scheduler follows a 4-step process:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Job Submission & Queueing
Jobs are submitted via gRPC API.

They are stored in a priority queue.

Jobs with higher priority execute first.

Each job has resource requirements (CPU, memory, GPU).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Resource Availability Check
Before execution, the scheduler checks if enough resources are available.

If resources are sufficient, the job is executed.

If resources are insufficient, the job remains queued.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Job Execution & Status Updates
The job is executed using subprocess (e.g., shell command).

During execution, system resources are updated.

Once the job is completed, resources are freed.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Merkle Tree Verification
After scheduling, jobs are hashed into a Merkle tree.

This allows distributed verification of job execution.

Other nodes can check if the scheduled jobs match the verified state.

üîπ Scheduler in Action
üîπ Scenario:

A user submits Job J1 (priority = 2, CPU = 4, Memory = 8GB).

The scheduler adds J1 to the queue.

The scheduler checks if enough resources are available.

If available, J1 starts execution.

After J1 completes, resources are freed, and the job is marked completed.

The system verifies job integrity using Merkle trees.

üîπ Why Use a Priority-Based Scheduler?
Ensures critical jobs run first (higher priority ‚Üí earlier execution).

Prevents resource starvation by intelligently managing resource allocation.

Allows distributed validation through Merkle tree verification.

Scalability‚Äîit can handle large numbers of jobs efficiently.




 a fully functional job scheduler with gRPC integration, ensuring that:

‚úÖ Jobs are scheduled correctly based on priority & available resources.
‚úÖ gRPC handles job submissions and status checks from remote clients.
‚úÖ Jobs execute properly, and their status updates dynamically.
‚úÖ Scheduling is continuous, handling new jobs as they arrive.

üìå Overview of Components
1Ô∏è‚É£ scheduler.proto (Defines gRPC Services)
Defines how clients communicate with the scheduler server.

2Ô∏è‚É£ scheduler_server.py (gRPC Server)
Runs the job scheduler.

Accepts job submissions and fetches job statuses.

Schedules and executes jobs.

3Ô∏è‚É£ scheduler_client.py (gRPC Client)
Submits jobs to the scheduler.

Fetches job statuses.

4Ô∏è‚É£ scheduler.py (Job Scheduling Logic)
Handles job queueing, execution, and resource management.
